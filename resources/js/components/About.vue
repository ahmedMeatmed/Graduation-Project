      <h3 class="fw-semibold">Who We Are</h3>
      <p>
        We are a team of 12 dedicated Engineering students working together on our graduation project. 
        Our project focuses on building an <strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</strong> to help detect, 
        analyze, and respond to suspicious network activities. With the rapid increase of cyber threats, 
        our mission is to contribute to stronger security solutions through innovation and teamwork.

      <h3 class="fw-semibold">Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        To design and implement an IDS that not only monitors and detects network intrusions in real time, 
        but also provides clear alerts and reports to system administrators for quick response. 
        We aim to make our system practical, efficient, and adaptable for different environments.
